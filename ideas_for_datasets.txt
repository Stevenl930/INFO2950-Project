Ideas for Datasets:
- Reddit: looking at posts, comments, subreddits etc. Really easy to get data using API
- Spotify: looking into geographical data of what artist are more popular where, genres, etc. Might be harder to get this data/not sure if available, will need to look into Spotify API more
- Census data: with the census coming up, looking at previous census data, finding trends, making predictions. Easy to find census data online
- IMDB: look into ratings, success/failures of actors and directors. Could use a web scraper to get the data from IMDB site
